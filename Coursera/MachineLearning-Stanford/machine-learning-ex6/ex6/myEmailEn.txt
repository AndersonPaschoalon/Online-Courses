Hi!

I've checked the latest Tempest logs from os-odl_l2-nofeature-ha scenario on ericsson-pod2:

Tempest environment:
Installer: fuel
Scenario: os-odl_l2-nofeature-ha
Node: ericsson-pod2
Date: Mon Feb 15 02:55:57 UTC 2016

(http://artifacts.opnfv.org/logs/functest/ericsson-pod2/brahmaputra/2016-02-15_05-12-19/brahmaputra/tempest/tempest.log)

There seems to be only one common reason for all the 12 failed test cases: there is no enough available floating IP addresses in the used external (public) network (the network with UUID 10c5376f-ef57-4aa2-8a53-c29d7057646d):
